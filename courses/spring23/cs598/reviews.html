	Writeup Grading
Does the review include all sections (summary, problem, contributions, flaws, topic question)
Are all assertions backed up (e.g. is a bad is not acceptable, but is a bad idea because ) is acceptable
Is the review concise? The summary should be a few sentences and give the essence of the design in the paper, not the problem. (E.g., paper is about how to build a multiprocessor operating is not acceptable, but paper is about building a multiprocessor operating system by layering abstractions that mask the existence of multiple is acceptable)
Did you understand the material? Are there factual flaws in the review? For example, if the paper defines a term, does the student use it appropriately? As another example, if you state that a paper is relevant because modern distributed systems do things the same way, is that true?
Assigning grades:

If the review does an excellent job on all four considerations, and provides genuinely insightful comments about the problem, contributions, flaws, or the per-topic question (if there is one), it should receive a check plus
If two or more of the four criteria are not met, the review should receive a check minus
Otherwise, it should receive a check. -->
