<p>Welcome to CS 598 RAP - Storage Systems: Theory and Practice!</p><br> 
<p>This class will cover an exciting set of topics in storage systems including TODO. We will read many influential papers and some recent ones, including many widely used systems.</p>

<br>
<p>Note: This course is a research-oriented, discussion-based one. That means,<br><br>
1. There is no text and most (if not all) classes will be based on research papers.<br>
2. The reading load will be somewhat heavy (2-3 papers each week); before each class, students are expected to read the assigned papers, and submit a review or answer a question related to the paper.<br>
3. An important part of this course is a research project that you will do in a small team (2-3 members); a good project involves exploring a new idea or conducting an in-depth study, and could potentially be published in a good systems conference. We will help you choose ideas and present your results.<br>
