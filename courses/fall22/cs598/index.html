<p>Welcome to CS 598 RAP - Storage Systems: Theory and Practice!</p>
<p>This class will cover an exciting set of topics in storage systems both local (e.g., key-value stores, file systems) and distributed (e.g., disaggregation, control-plane storage). We will strike a balance between reading old, influential papers and more recent ones from conferences such as OSDI, SOSP, EuroSys, FAST, and ATC.</p>

<p>This course is a research-oriented, discussion-based one. That means,
<ul>
<li>There is no text and most (if not all) classes will be based on research papers.</li>
<li>The reading load will be somewhat heavy (2-3 papers each week); before each class, students are expected to read the assigned papers, and submit a review or answer a question related to the paper.</li>
<li>An important part of this course is a research project that you will do in a small team (2-3 members); a good project involves exploring a new idea or conducting an in-depth study, and could potentially be published in a good systems conference.</li>
